A game created for Ludum Dare 26, with the theme 'minimalism'.  This is a
2-player competitive game where the goal is to paint the canvas in your colour.
Paint lasts for four blocks; after it has run out, a projectile spreads out the
paint on other tiles it goes over.

The game ends when the entire canvas is coloured, and the winner is the player
whose colour is the most common.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

To run from source, you must first compile.  This process requires GNU Make or
equivalent or the version of Visual whatever-it's-called that was used to
compile your Python version, and header files for SDL and Pygame must be
available on the system.  Just run

    make

On Windows, this requires the command-line compiler ('cl') to be on your path,
and assumes that SDL.h is in the directory 'sdl_include' above this directory
(horrible, I know).

Now, on systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run run.py with your Python 2
executable.

    CONTROLS

WASD/arrow keys: move players
space/right shift: fire paint ball; hold to charge and release faster
left shift/right ctrl: hold to move faster
F10: minimise

WASD is in the same place for the AZERTY, Dvorak and Colemak keyboard layouts
as well.
