Ludum Dare 26 game (theme: 'minimalism').

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

To run from source, you must first compile.  This process requires GNU Make or
equivalent or the version of Visual whatever-it's-called that was used to
compile your Python version, and header files for SDL and Pygame must be
available on the system.  Just run

    make

On Windows, this requires the command-line compiler ('cl') to be on your path,
and assumes that SDL.h is in the directory 'sdl_include' above this directory
(horrible, I know).

Now, on systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run run.py with your Python 2
executable.

    CONTROLS

F11, alt + enter: toggle fullscreen
F10: minimise

    LICENSING

Source code is available under the GPL version 3 (included).
